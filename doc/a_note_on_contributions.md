### A Note on Contributions

**Contribution statement**: All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project, participated in discussions and brainstorming activities. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 

**Note: models in bold were a focus of the contributor**

+ Maslova, Olha: managed communications; pre-processed data for Neural Networks; implemented GBM, **CNN on raw image data, and Neural Network on combined image and fiducial points data**. Contributed to presenatation, organization of Github files, Github ReadMes, and main.ipynb.

+ Li, Qiao: pre-processed fiducial points data; implemented **Weighted SVMs (fine-tuned)**, KNeighborsClassifier (slightly fine-tuned), DecisionTreeClassifier (not fine-tuned), RandomForestClassifier(not fine-tuned), AdaBoostClassifier (not fine-tuned); Contributed to presenatation, organization of main.ipynb and all other Github files, Github ReadMes, test script

+ Morrissey, Mark: implemented XGBoost, Ridge Classifier, Adaboost, and **Voting classifier (fine-tuned)**; Fine-tuned logistic regression and an alternative SVM for use in the final Voting Classifier model. Explored PCA and recursive feature elimination for dimensionality reduction reduction (did not improve error rate). Contributed to presenatation, Github ReadMes.

+ Yang, Yutong: performed initial model trials (SVC, KNN, SGD, RandomForest, Adaboost, XGBoost). Fine-tuned GBM on on fiducial points. Implemented **CNN** on raw images; Contributed to presenatation, organization of main.ipynb, all other Github files, Github ReadMes. Re-run all the models to time.

+ Zhang, Renyin: Researched possible models and fine tuned the models that teammates created, focusing on cnn and AdaBoost with SVM.
